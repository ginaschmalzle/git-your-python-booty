Blue indicates that you are not in edit mode. To enter (and edit) a cell like this one, double click on it.  Note the color of the cell outline turned **green**, indicating you are in edit mode.   \n",

Alternatively, short cut keys are **'a'** to add a cell and **'d'** to delete.  The trick here is to be sure you are not 'in the cell' -- meaning you are not in edit mode.  If you are in edit mode, a green box will outline the cell.  If you are outside of your cell, the box turns blue.
